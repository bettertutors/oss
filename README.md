Provisions: servers, monitors inventory, sets up orchestration, and enables logging and monitoring.

## Requirements

Once you've gotten keys setup with your provider, find/replace: `Provider.SOFTLAYER` with your one.

Currently using `SL_USER` and `SL_KEY` also, so you'll need to find/replace those occurrences also.

There are also some requirements which need installing, these can be loaded using this pip command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
